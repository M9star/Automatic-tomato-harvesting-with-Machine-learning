## Abstract
The agricultural industry continually seeks innovative solutions to enhance productivity, address labor shortages, and optimize crop harvesting processes. In this context, the development of an autonomous tomato harvesting robot equipped with machine learning 
capabilities presents a promising approach. Our project aims to design and implement an 
autonomous tomato harvesting robot with a 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) robotic arm, 
enabling precise and gentle fruit detachment to minimize damage and waste. At its core lies 
a sophisticated deep learning neural network, a lightweight model tailored to meet the realtime application requirements of CNNs in low-cost embedded systems such as IoT 
applications. Employing the state-of-the-art YOLOv4 tiny object detection with the Darknet 
framework, the system accurately identifies and locates unripe, semi-ripe, and ripe tomatoes 
in the field, surpassing traditional methods and ensuring efficient and accurate harvesting. 
By combining the dexterous 6DOF arm with vision from an Insta360 camera and YOLOv4's 
tiny yet robust detection capabilities in real-time, along with integrating a TOF sensor for 
depth calculation, our project paves the way for a future of autonomous and intelligent 
tomato harvesting. This innovative approach holds immense potential to boost agricultural 
efficiency and contribute to a more sustainable food production system.
